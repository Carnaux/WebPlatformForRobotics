##### Paper abstract

"This paper describes the creation of a system for creating web-based digital twins. The system has a 3D visual simulator, and this simulator runs directly in the browser and supports panel data visualization and augmented reality. To validate the system, a robotic physical arm was built with LEGO. In this arm were placed sensors connected to a microcontroller that sends the data to a database on the web. Your digital counterpart was created in our simulator. The article presents the results of this simulation."
