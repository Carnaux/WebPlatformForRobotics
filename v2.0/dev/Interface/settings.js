		DEFAULT SERIAL PORT
		Choose default serial port to set the connection port when loader is not used.

		PERSISTENT SERIAL CONNECTION
		Use isPersistent to hold the connection after app shutdown. The session is returned when
		relaunching. It's set to false by default because it blocks Arduino sketch upload process.
		Changes from chrome apps to node-webkit made this currently not working (?).
